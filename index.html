                <p class="nohigh" style="color: #5a525a;">My expertise in languages mainly surrounds object-oriented programming as when I started over 10 years ago I mainly used Java and JavaScript. I used these two up until I started to learn the Unity engine and then made the switch to C# later on. Throughout this time I also dabbled in HTML & CSS but most of my knowledge of it would come later in university at Dalhousie. In university is where I learned languages such as C, Kotlin and Haskell along with a lot of Java which I luckily already knew. I am now trying to broaden my horizon and learning C++ along with playing around with Python for fun. One of my favorite things to do is to learn new languages and hopefully one day this graph will have all its point on the top-right.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="nohigh" style="color: #5a525a;">I grew up in rural Cape Breton and as a kid I loved building Legos, video games, and writing short stories. These three things eventually brought me to this little unknown game at the time called Minecraft where I could combine all these into one. After a year or two of making my own custom maps in Minecraft, I wanted to explore my creativity further which is where GameMaker Studio comes in. As a kid I was always a fan of the creator of Minecraft Notch, the fact that he made my favourite game all by himself made me want to try out making games on my own. This is where my first complete game comes in SlimeyQuest. Just by looking at the game play you can see the vast amount of similarities with Minecraft and other popular games such as Terraria. You can also tell how young I was just by the fact that I spelled Slimey with an 'e' and never bothered to look up the correct spelling. SlimeyQuest proved to me that I could make any game I felt like and be able to show off my ideas like never before. Although Legos, video games such as Minecraft, and short stories allowed me to share my imagination and ideas none of these compared to making a game. After showing my friends and family the game it pushed me even further and ever since I've been working on games and projects nearly every day.<br><br>As I grew older I moved to making 3d games in Unity and after Unityscript was removed I switched to C# and have been using it as my main language ever since. Throughout this time I struggled to finish any games and ended up just making thousands of mini-games, demos, and barely started ideas. At the time I would get mad at myself as I believed I was being inefficient and wasting my time, when in reality these unfinished games would teach me a lot about programming and self-discipline. I failed to see at the time that every hour spent programming helped me improve and learn something new that I otherwise would not have.<br><br>At the end of Highschool, I started a project called SANCTION and no not the one I released now it just has the same name and logo, I know it's confusing. During this project I spend about 3 years refining different systems and gameplay loops but none of them were exciting to me personally. This version of SANCTION was a multiplayer Co-op game and had a fairly good-looking and advanced environment at the time for an indie game. But yet again I felt uninterested in the project and wanted to scrap it since so many years had passed and my became code outdated and horrible compared to my new standards which made me feel like giving up on game development altogether.<br><br>At this point, I was taking classes online as it was the middle of Covid and felt like I needed something to work on again for practice. I wanted to make something small in scope but also impressive in complexity and graphical fidelity. This is where modern-day SANCTION came in, I slowly took chunks of scripts and systems from the old game into a fresh project and refactored them to my new standard. This refactoring alone took months but from the years of using Unity, making the rest of the game was surprisingly quick because of all the spare time I had during Covid. And now we are at the present, Covid is over, SANCTION is still being worked on probably as you read this, and I am now graduating from Dalhousie in May. Been a very long 21 years but I enjoy programming just as much as I did 10 years ago when I started so I guess that's a good sign.</p>
